# Danger

Update: I decided to remove Danger from the project since it wasn't adding much value at the moment of the deletion.

The purpose of this document is to be a step by step guide on how to add Github Templates to your project.

* [Danger repo](https://github.com/danger/swift)

The current configuration of Danger in this project is just performing some basic checks on the PRs styles.
i.e: Check for the `WIP` keyword, check for the title and body length, check the addition of unit tests, etc. 

## Steps to cherry-pick üçí
1. Follow the installation docs on the `Danger` repo, since this may vary with time.
2. To copy the configuration from this project into yours, copy this into your `Dangerfile.swift` file:

```swift
import Danger

let danger = Danger()

// Pull request size
let bigPRThreshold = 400
let shortTitleThreshold = 5
let additions = danger.github.pullRequest.additions!
let deletions = danger.github.pullRequest.deletions!
let changedFiles = danger.github.pullRequest.changedFiles!

// Check PR size Threshold
if (additions + deletions > bigPRThreshold) {
    warn("PR size seems relatively large. ‚úÇÔ∏è If this PR contains multiple changes, please split each into separate PR will helps faster, easier review.")
}

// Pull request body validation
if danger.github.pullRequest.body == nil || danger.github.pullRequest.body!.isEmpty {
    warn("PR has no description. üìù You should provide a description of the changes that have made.")
}

// Pull request title validation
let prTitle = danger.github.pullRequest.title
if prTitle.contains("WIP") {
    warn("PR is classed as _Work in Progress_.")
}
if prTitle.count < shortTitleThreshold {
    warn("PR title is too short. üôè Please use a more descriptive title")
}

// Files changed and created should includes unit tests
let modified = danger.git.modifiedFiles
let editedFiles = modified + danger.git.createdFiles
let testFiles = editedFiles.filter { ($0.contains("Tests") || $0.contains("Test")) && ($0.fileType == .swift) }
if testFiles.isEmpty {
    warn("PR does not contain any files related to unit tests ‚úÖ (ignore if your changes do not require tests)")
}

// MARK: - SwiftLint
//SwiftLint.lint() - TODO: Make this work

message("üéâ The PR added \(additions) and removed \(deletions) lines. üóÇ \(changedFiles) files changed.")
```

3. To make the `Danger` script run using GitHub actions, check out this yml code:

```yml
name: Danger

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  Danger:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Danger Swift
        uses: danger/swift@2.0.3
        with:
          args: --failOnErrors --no-publish-check
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN }}
```
