# SwiftyPick 🦅🍒

Useful Swift code samples, extensions, functionalities and scripts to cherry-pick and use in your projects.

## Purpose

The idea behind this project is not to be a `pod` that users import into their own projects, but rather a collection of useful ideas, well-organized and documented, to cherry-pick as needed into another projects.
Every new piece of functionality will have a proper document explaining it's usage under the `Documentation` directory.

# TODOs
This is the list of things I want to add to the project in the near future:

- [ ] Useful UIKit Autolayout extension (ie: `add(_ subview: UIView, constraints: [NSLayoutConstraints])`)
- [ ] Logger: Object to log useful information to the console (and to report to analytics/crashlytics)
- [ ] NumberFormatter + Regional unit tests (ie: check the `,` or `.` separator for decimals/thousands depending on the region)
- [ ] CurrencyFormatter + Regional unit tests
- [ ] DateFormatter + Regional unit tests
- [ ] Lightweight `URLSession` networking layer
- [ ] Dynamic Fonts (For accessibility)
- [ ] UITests layer using Page Object pattern
- [ ] Schemes (prod/dev)
- [ ] UserDefaults easy access / FeatureFlags using UserDefaults
- [ ] UIView extension with some basic animations
- [ ] UITableViewCell/UICollectionViewCell extension for `register`, `dequeue`, and `cellReuseIdentifier`
- [ ] Firebase integration (Analytics/Crashlytics/AB Testing/Flags)
- [ ] Custom Operators from the `Advanced Swift` book
- [ ] GraphQL support
- [ ] A tableview in the home, where each cell will be the entry point to each feature (ie: color palettes, networking call via http, networking via graphQL, UI components, animations, formatters, etc)
- [ ] Settings view: dark mode, color palette, app icon, local feature flags, display backend calls for debug, change accessibility features, etc
