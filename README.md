# TODOs
This is the list of things I want to add to the project in the near future:

- [ ] UITableViewCell/UICollectionViewCell extension for `register`, `dequeue`, and `cellReuseIdentifier`
- [ ] UserDefaults easy access / FeatureFlags using UserDefaults
- [ ] Logger: Object to log useful information to the console (and to report to analytics/crashlytics)
- [ ] Lightweight `URLSession` networking layer
- [ ] PokedexViewController
    - Use MVP: PokedexPresenter, PokedexPresenting, PokedexPresentingDelegate
    - Use the new networking layer for the backend call
    - Unit test the presenter using a mock presenter to avoid the network call
- [ ] NumberFormatter + Regional unit tests (ie: check the `,` or `.` separator for decimals/thousands depending on the region)
- [ ] CurrencyFormatter + Regional unit tests
- [ ] DateFormatter + Regional unit tests
- [ ] Dynamic Fonts (For accessibility)
- [ ] UITests layer using Page Object pattern
- [ ] Schemes (prod/dev)
- [ ] UIView extension with some basic animations
- [ ] Firebase integration (Analytics/Crashlytics/AB Testing/Flags)
- [ ] Custom Operators from the `Advanced Swift` book
